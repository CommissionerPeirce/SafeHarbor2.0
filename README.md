## Proposed Securities Act Rule 195. Exemption for Qualifying Distributions of Autonomous Cryptotokens

***Prolegomena to Preliminary Notes:***

This is a working draft prepared in a single day as part of LeXpunK working group. At this point, it is just a strawman and everything is still very subject to rethinking and revision. A non-exclusive list of mixed definite and possible to-dos is appended to the end of the document.  

***Preliminary Notes:***

*The analysis of whether a particular offering or distribution of a digital asset constitutes a securities offering is not static and does not strictly depend on either the nature of the digital asset or the manner of the offering or distribution. It is common practice for developers of autonomous cryptosystems to distribute governance tokens to users of the systems essentially for free (or, put another way, in recognition of or exchange for the usage of the systems by such users). There is significant doubt and debate over whether such distributions--sometimes characterized as "airdrops" and other times as "liquidity mining," depending on the exact details of the distribution--may constitute securities offerings to the public which must be registered with the SEC. Our view is that, under appropriate conditions, the distributions of governance tokens to builders or users of autonomous software systems advances important public policy goals, does not carry the same risks as the capital-raising and investment decisions designed to be protected by the securities registration laws, and should be exempt from registration with the SEC, regardless of whether the tokens are or may otherwise be involved in other transactions which constitute investment contracts.*

*Accordingly, this safe harbor is intended to provide initial development teams for autonomous cryptosystems that are governed or accessed through the use of autonomous cryptotokens with an exemption from registration for the post-operational offer and free (non-capital-raising) distribution of such autonomous cryptotokens to users of the autonomous cryptosystem and the pre-operational distribution of such autonomous cryptotokens to the builders of the autonomous cryptosystem. The safe harbor is designed to protect recipients of autonomous cryptotokens by requiring disclosures tailored to the needs of the users and preserving the potential application of the anti-fraud provisions and secondary market provisons of the federal securities laws..*

*A Q&A explaining certain design decisions underlying the substance of the safe harbor is included at the end of the document*

*Rule 195 is not an exclusive safe harbor. A person who does not meet all of the applicable conditions of Rule 195 still may claim any other available exemption under the Securities Act of 1933 for the offer and sale of Tokens.*

**(g)  Definitions.**

&ensp; &ensp; (1) *autonomous cryptosystem* means:

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (a) the combination of a particular autonomous cryptonetwork and an open cryptoledger maintained thereby; or

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (b) the combination of particular autonomous cryptocode, a particular open cryptoledger on which the autonomous cryptocode is verifiably stored and a particular autonomous cryptonetwork which maintains such open cryptoledger and executes such autonomous cryptocode 

&ensp; &ensp; (2) *autonomous cryptonetwork* means a peer-to-peer network that: (a) consists of computers running open cryptoclients which transmit and receive data among each other over the Internet, execute operations on such data and record such data and the results of such operations on an open cryptoledger; (b) does not depend for its continuing operation or availability on, and is not owned, controlled or arbitrarily modifiable by, any single person or single group of extrinsically affiliated persons; and (c) permits any Internet-connected, consumer-grade computer running the open cryptoclient to obtain an accurate and complete copy of the open cryptoledger and freely transmit messages to and read messages from all other open cryptoclients on such network, in each case, without any permission, authorization, identification or credentialling of such computer or the owner or operator of such computer.

&ensp; &ensp; (3) *open cryptoclient* means: (a) human-readable software code implementing a peer-to-peer networking and data consensus software protocol that allows participants in the network to form consensus regarding canonical data and perform transactions in electronic units of accounts solely through the use of cryptographic proofs; and (b) all machine code, bytecode, runtime code and other derivatives of the software referred to in the preceding clause ‘(a)’, provided that the software described in the preceding clauses ‘(a)’ and ‘(b)’ of this paragraph is freely and readily available and licensed to the general public for use, copy, study and modification. 

&ensp; &ensp; (4) *open cryptoledger* means an electronic database that: (a) is created, stored and updated by a peer-to-peer network of open cryptoclients; and (b) can be independently verified through cryptographic methods as having been created and updated in accordance with the data consensus protocol embedded in the open cryptoclients. 

&ensp; &ensp; (5) *autonomous cryptocode* means a copy of certain software code such that: (a) the software code was designed primarily to be run and facilitate transactions on one or more autonomous cryptonetworks; (b) the copy is verifiably stored and has its results of execution recorded on the open cryptoledger of an autonomous cryptonetwork; and (c) the copy is executable by any open cryptoclient within the execution environment of the autonomous cryptonetwork, provided that: (1) the software code is freely and readily available and licensed to the general public for use, copy, study and modification; and (2) if the copy consists of bytecode, machine code or other non-human-readable code, then the copy was verifiably compiled from human-readable source code that is freely and readily available and licensed to the general public for use, copy, study and modification.

&ensp; &ensp; (6) *autonomous cryptotoken* means any electronic unit of account that: 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (a) is natively created, stored and updated within and by means of an autonomous cryptosystem; 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (b) could reasonably be expected to have material pecuniary value; 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (c) solely through operation of the relevant autonomous cryptosystems, enables the controller of the electronic unit of account to:

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (1) pay for the use of an autonomous cryptosystem; 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (2) vote in the governance or control of an autonomous cryptosystem or any parameters or features thereof; or 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (3) capture, track, access, receive or otherwise benefit from the value of an autonomous cryptosystem based on the use, popularity or adoption of such autonomous cryptosystem (including any electronic units of account paid into such autonomous cryptosystem as usage fees); and 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (d)  does not represent the contractual right to receive any payment or distribution from any person (in respect of any payment of principal or interest on a debt, distribution of profits, assets or dividends, or otherwise). 

&ensp; &ensp; (7) *autonomous cryptotreasury* means an autonomous cryptosystem that exclusively controls either the generation of or issuance of un-generated or unissued autonomous cryptotokens of a given type based on the results of governance voting of issued autonomous cryptotokens of the same type. 

&ensp; &ensp; (8) *qualifying distribution* means: 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (a) the public distribution of any autonomous cryptotokens, in one or a series of transactions, over any period of time after the corresponding autonomous cryptosystem described in paragraph 6(c) has become publicly operational, to: 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (1) any users of the autonomous cryptosystem, solely in exchange for or recognition of using the autonomous cryptosystem in one or more transactions or continuously during a designated period of time; 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (2) if the corresponding autonomous cryptosystem is of the type described in paragraph 1(b), to users of the autonomous cryptosystem of the type described in paragraph 1(a) on which the corresponding autonomous cryptosystem is stored and executed, solely in recognition of historical use of the autonomous cryptosystem of the type described in paragraph 1(a); or 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; (3) an autonomous cryptotreasury controlled by holders of the autonomous cryptotokens; or 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; (b) the private distribution of any autonomous cryptotokens, in one or a series of transactions over any period of time before the corresponding autonomous cryptosystem described in paragraph 6(c) has become publicly operational, to members of the initial development team, provided that: (1) the percentage of the total possible maximum supply of the autonomous cryptotokens to the initial development team and all its members does not exceed 30% in the aggregate or 5% to any member; (2) within 30 days of the autonomous cryptosystem becoming operational, the initial development team and its members collectively do not beneficially hold or control a majority of the economic benefits or voting powers associated with the autonomous cryptotoken (excluding any such tokens held in the autonomous cryptotreasury). 

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; For the avoidance of doubt, for a distribution of cryptotokens to constitute a qualifying distribution under clause ‘(a)’ of this paragraph (8), neither the initial development team nor any of their respective related persons, may be paid any sale proceeds or capital by users of the autonomous cryptosystem as consideration for distribution of the autonomous cryptotokens; instead, users must be entitled to receive the autonomous cryptotokens solely as a result of their use of their post-operational use of the corresponding autonomous cryptosystem or their historical pre-operational use of the autonomous cryptosystem on which the first autonomous cryptosystem is stored and operated.  

&ensp; &ensp; (9)  *initial development team*  means any person, group of persons, or entity that provides the essential managerial efforts for the development of the network prior to the first public qualifying distribution of the autonomous cryptotokens pursuant to clause ‘(a)’ of the definition of “qualifying distribution” set forth in paragraph (g)(8) of this section and makes the initial filing of a notice of reliance on this safe harbor and a *member* of an initial development team means any person, group of persons or entity that provides services to or with the intiital development team.

&ensp; &ensp; (10)  *related person* means with respect to any person, any affiliate or immediate family member of such person. 

&ensp; &ensp; (11)  *extrinsically affiliated* means, with respect to any two persons and any autonomous cryptotokens, that: (a) due to arrangements or agreements outside of the autonomous cryptosystem (such as ownership of one person's equity securities by another), one such person directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the other person in respect of their acquisition, holding, voting, using or disposing of the autonomous cryptotokens; or (b) such persons have agreed to act together for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting, using or disposing of the autonomous cryptotokens; provided, however, that two persons independently using or agreeing to use the autonomous cryptotokens for their intended purposes within the autonomous cryptosystem (such as by participating in a proof- of-stake consensus process that results in agreement among stakers or validators) shall not constitute such an agreement to act together.

**Questions and Answers**

Q. Why are the definitions so narrow? They exclude my favorite project because <the smart contracts are proxy-upgradeable by a dev multisig/the mempool is read-permissioned/the software code isn’t FOSS>. Unfair!

A. We realize that good autonomous cryptosystem projects come in many shapes and sizes and have many different (sometimes very gradual) decentralization plans. We feel that a safe harbor needs to have a compelling rationale to be accepted by regulators, legislators and even the general public. Unless the goal is to amend all of securities laws (which might be a worthy goal, but is unlikely to be accomplished in the near future), then we need to carefully explain why certain situations should be subject to different (less strict) rules. The best rationale for this is that the systems are not under the discretionary control of any small group and exist as open-source public digital goods available to all under very trust-minimized conditions. Importantly, because Rule 195 is intended to be a non-exclusive safe harbor, the fact that a particular system or its tokens might not be covered under Rule 195 does NOT entail that a distribution fo such tokens definitely is a securities offering--it merely means that the distribution does not rise to the level of a "qualifying distribution" that *clearly* deserves exemption. 

---

Q. Why aren’t issuances of tokens to the Initial Development Team prior to the autonomous cryptosystem being operational required to comply with the securities laws? 

A. We believe the bona fide builders of an autonomous cryptosystem deserve to receive autonomous cryptotokens for their work, even if they are not “accredited investors.” While private placement exemptions such as Rule 701 could work to place securities into service providers’ hands, the conditions of Rule 701 are too restrictive in the context of building autonomous cryptosystems because: (a) many open-source software teams choose to collaborate on an unincorporated, non-hierarchical basis, and thus there is no “issuer” that they provide services to such that they could qualify to receive a security from that issuer under Rule 701; and (b) many cryptosystems may be developed on a joint-venture-like basis involving multiple development studios, code audit firms, and other types of business entities working in the field of autonomous cryptosystems, and business entities are generally not eligible to receive securities pursuant Rule 701. Moreover, members of the Initial Development Team will typically be fully informed about the risks and rewards of the autonomous cryptosystem and autonomous cryptotokens, have significant influence over their design and exert a significant part of the essential efforts required for their development—thus, the Initial Development Team does not need the protection of the securities laws with respect to their decision to trade labor for autonomous cryptotokens, similar to how the “knowledgeable employees” of an issuer are typically treated as being accredited investors in connection with that issuer’s own securities.

Q. How does this proposal differ from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s proposed Rule 195 Safe Harbor 2.0?  

A. This proposal borrows a number of elements, concepts and textual provisions of Hester Peirce’s seminal and deservedly praised Rule 195 / Safe Harbor 2.0 proposal, but has some key differences. We believe the Safe Harbor 2.0 proposal has not garnered the necessary buy-in from cryptoskeptical regulators and politicians, for several principal reasons: 

&ensp; &ensp; <u>Breadth of the Exemption</u>. Commissioner Peirce’s proposal provides a high degree of clarity—in favor of cryptocurrency enthusiasts—that, during the relevant three-year network maturation period, tokens will not be treated as securities in any context, assuming the absence of fraud. However, to a skeptical regulator or politician, this broad carve-out runs the risk of unintended or unforeseen consequences—For example, what if swaps, indexes or traditional funds relating to these tokens are created on a pure centralized basis that implicates the securities laws—will the SEC still be able to assert jurisdiction over such instruments? What about a hedge fund that seeks to act as a T. Boone-Pickens style “hostile takeover investor” and makes a coercive or preclusive tender offer in an attempt to unfairly acquire a majority of the tokens in a way that damages dissenting token holders—will the SEC have no enforcement tools to use against such a person? What about “insider trading” abuses by third parties beyond the initial development team who somehow gain an outsized influence over the autonomous cryptosystem at a later stage? The securities laws are simply too complex and multifarious for a regulator or politician to be confident it is not “giving away the farm” by exempting tokens wholesale from a large swathe of the securities laws during some period of time. 

&ensp; &ensp; <u>Tokens vs. Manner of Distributing</u>. Commissioner Peirce’s proposal focuses on tokens and the respects in which they are or are not to be treated as securities during some period of initial network maturation. In doing so, it fails to discriminate among different kinds of transactions in tokens, some of which may be more deserving of securities regulation than others. Selling tokens to the public in a capital-raising or enterprise “exit” transaction implicates many of the same issues as a traditional sale of securities, regardless of the fact that what are being sold are tokens rather than stock, bonds or other traditional securities. By contrast, issuing tokens to team members or users outside of a literal “sale” poses fewer risks to the public and less strongly implicates the securities laws. 

&ensp; &ensp; <u>Fairness; Regulatory Arbitrage</u>. Another key objection we have heard to Commissioner Peirce’s proposal is that it presents too many regulatory arbitrage opportunities to traditional issuers or technically incapable issuers. Because the proposal exempts tokens even if they are initially under centralized control, so long as decentralization occurs within three years, it confers special regulatory benefits on those who have not yet created, and may ultimately be unsuccessful in creating, a special decentralized technology. Decentralized technology is challenging, and thus, even with the best of intentions, a team may overestimate its ability or time needed to achieve “network maturity”. Alternatively, a traditional technology company could, by issuing a token tied the value of the company’s efforts, get a risk-free three-year jump start on its IPO, provided that it is prepared to ultimately become an exchange-act-reporting company within three years; this would provide an unfair advantage that serves no positive social purpose. 

With the benefit of hindsight after engaging in discussions and debates over Commissioner Peirce’s proposal over the course of nearly two years, our proposal takes the aforementioned objections into account (with the hope of gaining broader consensus) by: 

&ensp; &ensp; (a)	Exempting a particular type of distribution of the token—a “qualifying distribution” to users and builders, which must not involve raising capital or exit proceeds for the initial development team—rather than exempting the token itself. This leaves more room for regulators to assert other kinds of securities law issues to address abuses (e.g., by secondary market participants such as cryptoexchanges) or unanticipated issues. 

&ensp; &ensp; (b)	Requiring that only special autonomous software systems that serve an important public policy goal are entitled to this special exemption from otherwise stringent securities registration laws. Whereas in Commissioner Peirce’s proposal the systems may start off as non-special as long as they become special within three years, we require that they be special at the outset. This means that to be eligible, the relevant cryptosystems must already be autonomous, and, in effect, serve as a community-run public good independent of the initial development team. This theme manifests itself in our proposal in a number of ways—for example, unlike in the Peirce proposal, our proposal requires that to be eligible for this special exemption, the relevant software must be free open source software. This is a sine qua non of a software system that is intended to constitute a public good fulfilling an important public policy purpose and to be independent from a proprietary enterprise. This also dramatically limits potential abuses of the exemption as a regulatory arbitrage strategy for an otherwise traditional business enterprise. 

&ensp; &ensp; (c)	Requiring that the initial development team be subject to a minimum 12-month post-public-launch lockup of their autonomous cryptotokens, which prohibits not only literal transfers of the token but also any divestiture of the rights or benefits or risks of ownership of the autonomous cryptotokens. This mirrors the 12-month holding period applicable to “restricted securities” under Rule 144. As a side note, we would hope that the absence of control over the autonomous cryptosystem by the initial development team moots the need to consider their autonomous cryptotokens “control securities” status under Rule 144--though this proposal is agnostic on that issue.

Q. I noticed that "qualifying distributions" do not seem cover *sales* of tokens by the initial development team (whether to the public or on the private market). What is the thinking here? If there is no exemption for team token sales, how will they ever sell their tokens in compliance with securities laws? 

A. Correct. By design, "qualifying distributions" do not include any *sales* of tokens by the initial development team. Consistent with the functionalist-minded, transaction-by-transaction approach with which the proposal has been drafted (as discussed above), we feel that sales of tokens by the development team raise heightened policy concerns as compared to free distributions of tokens to users and builders. Therefore, to increase the chances of regulatory or legislative acceptance of this proposal, we are leaving open the possibility that sales of tokens by the development team could constitute securities transactions, which would either require registration or a separate exemption. Whether such sales are securities transactions, and, if so, what exemptions or registration options would be available for such sales, will be a facts-and-circumstances analysis.

**Definite and Possible To-Dos For Refinement of this Proposal:** 

[__] think through whether some more wiggle room should be added for limited 'trustful' features (e.g., Curve-style emergency multisig, multisig with limited security-response authority and a timelock before changes, etc.) 

[__] tighten up drafting generally (e.g., define a term to avoid certain repetitious phrases re: open source software, etc.,) 

[__] potentially tighten up language/substance around the meaning of control by the initial development team (right now has lazy text about "control of a majority of economic benefits or voting power")--think about total supply vs. circulating supply vs. votable supply and potentially refine the standard around that 

[__] consider being even more liberal and allowing a 3-month grace period to become fully decentralized, and thus adding back something like the "network maturity" and "exit report" standards from Peirce's safe harbor (it is my observation that most developers are very uncomfortable being decentralized from day 1, for both security-oriented reasons and practical time-to-market reasons) ...OTOH, maybe those things can be addressed by delaying token distribution until after the system has been live for a while

[__] scour other safe harbor forks for potential good ideas 

[__] include more fulsome description of the public policy goals achieved by autonomous cryptosystems and autonomous cryptotokens--some good ideas [here](https://twitter.com/glenweyl/status/1478021789250772995)

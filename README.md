# Proposed Safe Harbor – Time-limited Exemption for Tokens.

_**This potential safe harbor is not a rule, regulation, or statement of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It cannot be relied on. It does not necessarily reflect the views of the Securities and Exchange Commission or my fellow Commissioners.**_

## Proposed Securities Act Rule 195. Time-limited exemption for Tokens.

_**Preliminary Notes:**_

1.  _The analysis of whether a digital asset is offered or sold as a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the digital asset. A Token may be offered and sold initially as a security because it is wrapped in a transaction involving an investment contract, but the Token may later be offered and sold outside of an investment contract. For example, sales of a particular Token likely would not constitute sales of an investment contract if purchasers could no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts._

_However, for a network to mature into a functional or decentralized network that is not dependent upon a single person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts, the Tokens must be distributed to and freely tradeable by potential users, programmers, and participants in the network. The application of the federal securities laws to the primary distribution of Tokens and secondary transactions frustrates the network’s ability to achieve maturity and prevents Tokens sold as a security from functioning as non-securities on the network._

_Accordingly, this safe harbor is intended to provide Initial Development Teams with a three-year time period within which they can facilitate participation in, and the continued development of, a functional or decentralized network, exempt from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws so long as certain conditions are met. The safe harbor is designed to protect Token purchasers by requiring disclosures tailored to the needs of the purchasers and preserving the application of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws to Token distributions by an Initial Development Team relying on the safe harbor._

_By the conclusion of the three-year period, the Initial Development Team must determine whether Token transactions involve the offer or sale of a security. Token transactions may not constitute securities transactions if the network has matured to a functioning or decentralized network. The definition of Network Maturity is intended to provide clarity as to when a Token transaction should no longer be considered a security transaction but the analysis with respect to any particular network will require an evaluation of the particular facts and circumstances._

1.  _Rule 195 is not an exclusive safe harbor. A person who does not meet all of the applicable conditions of Rule 195 still may claim any other available exemption under the Securities Act of 1933 for the offer and sale of Tokens._
